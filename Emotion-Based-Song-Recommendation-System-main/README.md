## 🎵 Emotion-Based Song Recommendation System (Python Version)
### 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered music recommendation system that suggests songs based on user emotions.
It was developed using Python and machine learning techniques to analyze emotions and recommend suitable songs. 
The project has now been redeveloped using React.js and Django for improved functionality and scalability.

### 🚀 Features
- Emotion Detection: Uses machine learning to classify emotions.
- Music Recommendation: Matches detected emotions with relevant songs.
- Spotify API Integration: Fetches and plays recommended tracks.
- Simple GUI: Built using Tkinter / OpenCV for easy interaction.
### Recuirements :
#### 📌 Modules Used
🧠 Machine Learning & Emotion Detection
- OpenCV – For face detection and image processing.
- TensorFlow/Keras – For training and running the emotion recognition model.
- numpy – For handling numerical computations.
####  🎵 Music Recommendation & API Integration
- spotipy – For integrating with the Spotify API to fetch and play songs.
- pandas – For managing and processing song datasets.
####  🖥️ GUI & User Interaction
- tkinter – For building a simple GUI (if used).
- streamlit – For creating a web-based interface (if used).
####  ⚙️ Backend & Utility
- requests – For making API requests to Spotify.
- json – For handling API responses.
- pickle – For saving and loading ML models.
